1, Identify The Requirements
•	Type of application
•	Supported ios  and Android os

2, Set Up the Testing Environment
•	Install development tools:
o	Xcode (for iOS simulators)
o	Android Studio (for Android emulators) or eclips ide
o	Related java versions 
o	Appium server

•	Install Appium for cross-platform UI automation
•	Appium inspector/Appium GUI
•	Use real devices for critical testing (especially iOS, as simulators are limited)
3. Plan the Test Strategy
•	Create a test matrix:
o	Devices (screen sizes, OS versions)
o	Features (login, navigation, permissions, etc.)
•	Prioritize tests: Smoke → Regression → Exploratory
4. Write Platform-Aware Test Cases
•	Test common workflows (e.g., login, add item, logout)
•	Handle platform differences (e.g., iOS may use “Back” buttons at the top, Android uses soft keys)

5. Perform Key Types of Testing
•	Functional Testing: Validate app workflows
•	UI Testing: Check layout across devices
•	Interrupt Testing: Calls, notifications, app minimization
•	Network Testing: Test behavior in offline/slow connections
•	Compatibility Testing: Different OS versions and screen sizes
•	Security Testing: Permissions, data handling

6. Automate Common Scenarios
Use Appium to write cross-platform tests in a common language (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Python):
•	Set up desired capabilities dynamically
•	Use selectors (ID, XPath) to find elements
•	Run tests on both Android and iOS from the same codebase (with conditional logic if needed)
________________________________________
7. Use CI Tools for Scalable Testing
•	Integrate Appium with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI
•	Run tests automatically on every code push or build
________________________________________
8. Report and Debug Issues
•	Use screenshots and logs to report platform-specific bugs
•	Track issues in tools like JIRA or GitHub Issues
